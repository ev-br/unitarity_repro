abstract: "This article reports on a successful exercise in a partial reproduction of a
           large-scale Monte Carlo simulation of the unitary regime of the
           Hubbard model. While the main computational code is in Fortran, and
           is thus largely invariant under evolution of both hardware and
           software, this exercise highlights the need for human-readable and
           human-manageable documentation of the computational pipeline."
